## 📖 Photo Journal Backend

For my latest **backend-only project**, I expanded on the idea of my **React-based Gratitude Journal App** by adding a **diary feature**. This backend allows users to create **1 diary post daily**, featuring **photo uploads** and **captions**.

### Features:

- **📝 User Registration:** Users can register and verify their email (login is enabled only after the verification link send per email is clicked).
- **🔐 Secure Login:** Login functionality that ensures only verified users can access their profile.
- **🗑️ Profile Deletion:** Users can delete their profile along with all associated posts and uploaded photos.
- **📅 Diary Post Creation:** Create a new diary post daily with a photo and caption.
- **🔍 Search Posts:** Retrieve posts by a specific date.
- **🕰️ Memories:** Fetch diary entries from the same day in previous years, creating a timeline of memories.

This project is built with **Node.js/Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Cloudinary** for image storage. It's designed to offer a **photo journal experience** with a focus on backend functionality.
